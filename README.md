# free-ai-models

USE AI MODELS AS FULL FREE.

There is some nodejs scripts that I used it for free models. you should handle and structure it in a simple nodejs project, sorry for that.
Open router collected almost ai models in one api. we use it for getting free of them.

**Attention, some models work fine without any credits, but to able to use all free models, you should have 10$ credits. its strange, but yeah, it is :/


## install lighter:
1. Install nodejs

2. Create an account in OpenRouter

3. For use all free models, charge 10$ credit.

4. Get Api Key from open router dashboard.

5. Use this script for free ai models.
